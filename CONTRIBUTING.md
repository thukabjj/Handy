# Contributing to Dictum

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Dictum! This guide will help you get started with contributing to this open source speech-to-text application.

## Philosophy

Dictum aims to be the most forkable speech-to-text app. The goal is to create both a useful tool and a foundation for others to build upon -- a well-patterned, simple codebase that serves the community. We prioritize:

- **Simplicity**: Clear, maintainable code over clever solutions
- **Extensibility**: Make it easy for others to fork and customize
- **Privacy**: Keep everything local and offline
- **Accessibility**: Free tooling that belongs in everyone's hands

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager
- Platform-specific build tools (see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md))

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork**:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/Handy.git
   cd Handy
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:cjpais/Handy.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

5. **Run in development mode**:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

For detailed platform-specific setup instructions, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

### Understanding the Codebase

Dictum follows a clean architecture pattern:

**Backend (Rust - `src-tauri/src/`):**

- `lib.rs` - Main application entry point with Tauri setup
- `error.rs` - Structured error handling (`HandyError`, `ErrorCategory`)
- `ollama_client.rs` - Streaming LLM client for AI features
- `managers/` - Core business logic:
  - `audio.rs` - Audio recording and device management
  - `model.rs` - Model downloading and management
  - `transcription.rs` - Speech-to-text processing pipeline
  - `history.rs` - Transcription history storage (SQLite)
  - `active_listening.rs` - Continuous transcription with AI insights
  - `ask_ai.rs` - Multi-turn voice conversations with local LLM
  - `ask_ai_history.rs` - Conversation persistence (SQLite)
  - `rag.rs` - Retrieval-Augmented Generation knowledge base
  - `suggestion_engine.rs` - Context-aware quick responses
- `audio_toolkit/` - Low-level audio processing (recording, VAD, diarization, loopback, mixing)
- `commands/` - Tauri command handlers (audio, models, transcription, history, active_listening, ask_ai, rag, suggestions)
- `shortcut/` - Global keyboard shortcut handling
- `settings/` - Application settings (general, active_listening, ask_ai, knowledge_base, suggestions)
- `utils/` - Shared utilities (SafeLock/SafeRwLock, clipboard, overlay, tray)

**Frontend (React/TypeScript - `src/`):**

- `App.tsx` - Main application component
- `components/` - React UI components (settings, model-selector, onboarding, overlay)
- `hooks/` - Reusable React hooks
- `stores/` - Zustand state management (settings, models, errors)
- `bindings.ts` - Auto-generated Tauri type bindings (via tauri-specta)
- `lib/errors/` - Frontend error handling utilities
- `i18n/` - Internationalization (16 languages)

For more details, see the Architecture section in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Suggesting Features

We use GitHub Discussions for feature requests rather than issues. This keeps issues focused on bugs and actionable tasks while allowing more open-ended conversations about features.

### Before Suggesting a Feature

1. **Search existing discussions** at [github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions)
2. **Check common feature requests**:
   - [Post-processing / Editing Transcripts](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions/168)
   - [Keyboard Shortcuts / Hotkeys](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions/211)

### Submitting a Feature Request

1. Go to [Discussions](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions)
2. Click "New discussion"
3. Choose the appropriate category (Ideas, Feature Requests, etc.)
4. Describe your feature idea including:
   - The problem you're trying to solve
   - Your proposed solution
   - Any alternatives you've considered
   - How it fits with Dictum's philosophy

## Making Code Contributions

### Before You Start

**This is critical:** Before writing any code, please do the following:

1. **Search existing issues and PRs** - Check both open AND closed issues and pull requests. Someone may have already addressed this, or there may be a reason it was closed.
   - [Open issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues)
   - [Closed issues](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
   - [Open PRs](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pulls)
   - [Closed PRs](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)

2. **If something was previously closed** - If you want to revisit a closed issue or PR, you need to:
   - Provide a strong argument for why it should be reconsidered
   - Gather community feedback first via [Discussions](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions)
   - Link to that discussion in your PR

3. **Get community feedback for features** - PRs with demonstrated community interest are **much more likely to be merged**. Start a discussion, get feedback, and link to it in your PR. This helps ensure Dictum stays focused and useful for the most people without becoming bloated.

Community feedback is essential to keeping Dictum the best it can be for everyone. It helps prioritize what matters most and prevents feature creep.

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clean, maintainable code
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Keep commits focused and atomic

3. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Run `bun run test` for frontend tests
   - Run `make test-rust` for Rust tests
   - Test on your target platform(s)
   - Verify existing functionality still works
   - Use debug mode to verify audio/transcription behavior

4. **Commit your changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: describe the bug fix"
   ```

   Use conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for test additions/changes
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

5. **Keep your fork updated**:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the [Dictum repository](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy)
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your fork and branch
   - Fill out the PR template completely, including:
     - Clear description of changes
     - Links to related issues or discussions
     - **Community feedback** (especially important for features)
     - How you tested the changes
     - Screenshots/videos if applicable
     - Breaking changes (if any)

   **Remember:** PRs with community support are prioritized. If you haven't already, start a [discussion](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/discussions) to gather feedback before or alongside your PR. It is not explicitly required to gather feedback, but it certainly helps your PR get merged faster.

### AI Assistance Disclosure

**AI-assisted PRs are welcome!** Use whatever tools help you contribute, just be upfront about it.

In your PR description, please include:

- Whether AI was used (yes/no)
- Which tools were used (e.g., "Claude Code", "GitHub Copilot", "ChatGPT")
- How extensively it was used (e.g., "generated boilerplate", "helped debug", "wrote most of the code")

### Code Style Guidelines

**Rust:**

- Follow standard Rust formatting (`cargo fmt`)
- Run `cargo clippy` and address warnings
- Use `HandyError` with `ErrorCategory` for error returns (not plain strings)
- Use `SafeLock`/`SafeRwLock` for mutex access (never `.unwrap()` on locks)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add doc comments for public APIs

**TypeScript/React:**

- Use TypeScript strictly, avoid `any` types
- Functional components with hooks
- Zod schemas for runtime type validation and inference
- `useCallback` hooks for stable function references
- Destructure props with defaults: `disabled = false`
- Container component pattern for layout
- Composition over inheritance
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

**Imports:**

- Group imports: external libs, internal modules, relative imports
- Use type imports for TypeScript: `import type { Settings }`
- Named imports preferred over default exports

**i18n:**

- All user-facing strings must use i18next translations
- ESLint enforces this via `eslint-plugin-i18next`
- Add new keys to `src/i18n/locales/en/translation.json`
- Use in components: `const { t } = useTranslation(); t('key.path')`

### Testing Your Changes

**Automated Tests:**

```bash
# Frontend tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)
bun run test

# Rust tests
make test-rust

# All tests
make test
```

**Manual Testing:**

- Run the app in development mode: `make dev`
- Test your changes with debug mode enabled
- Verify on multiple platforms if possible
- Test with different audio devices
- Try various transcription scenarios

**Building for Production:**

```bash
bun run tauri build
```

Test the production build to ensure it works as expected.
